      <li> <strong>Vinoin Vincely</strong>, Karthik Vishwanath. <strong> <em>[Accepted]</em> </strong> <br> <em>"Exploring light-losses in Integrating Sphere measurements using Monte-Carlo simulations."</em>
        <br>Proceedings of SPIE. (2020) <br> <!-- Add pictures of each journal page -->

      <p style="margin-right:6em; margin-left:2em;">The Integrating Sphere (IS) combined with the Inverse Adding-Doubling algorithm (IAD), is a poplar method of extracting broadband optical properties from turbid media. However, IS measurements face errors in the form of light loss. These arise both due to the finiteness of the physical sample and comparable size of the IS sample port and the illumination beam. Here, these error are quantified using a robust Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation. The project will be presented at the SPIE Optics and Photonics conference, Feb 2020.</p>

      <li> <strong>Vinoin Vincely</strong>, Karthik Vishwanath.<br> <em>"Extracting broadband optical properties from uniform optical phantoms using an integrating sphere and inverse adding-doubling."</em>
        <br>Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 10486 (2018) <a href="http://spie.org/Publications/Proceedings/Paper/10.1117/12.2291950" target="_blank" style="float:right">Link to article</a><br> <!-- Add pictures of each journal page -->

      <p style="margin-right:6em; margin-left:2em;">The objective of this experiment is to analyze the accuracy of the Integrating Sphere (IS) and the Inverse-Adding Doubling (IAD) algorithm in extracting broadband optical properties of turbid media. Though there exists highly accurate theoretical models, such as Monte-Carlo Simulations, the IAD proves to be a computationally efficient technique. The project explores theoretical and experimental corrections made to the estiamtion technique to improve its overall accuracy. The project was presented at the SPIE Optics and Photonics conference, Jan 2018.</p>

      <li> Adam Eaton, <strong>Vinoin Vincely</strong>, Paige Lloyd, Kurt Hugenberg, Karthik Vishwanath.<br><em>"The reliability and accuracy of estimating heart-rates from RGB video recorded on a consumer grade camera"</em>
        <br>Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 10055 (2017) <a href="http://spie.org/Publications/Proceedings/Paper/10.1117/12.2252629" target="_blank" style="float:right">Link to article</a><br>

      <p style="margin-right:6em; margin-left:2em;">Video Photoplethysmography (VPPG) is a numerical technique to process standard RGB video data of exposed human skin and extracting the heart-rate from the skin areas. Being a non-contact technique, VPPG has the potential to provide estimates of subjectâ€™s heart-rate, respiratory rate, and even the heart rate variability of human subjects with potential applications ranging from infant monitors, remote healthcare and psychological experiments, particularly given the non-contact and sensor-free nature of the technique. This is my first Undergraduate Research Project that gave me an insight in what entails working in a research lab. The project was presented at the SPIE Optics and Photonics conference, Jan 2017.</p>

      <li>Alex Reigle, Kelly Mason, Jessie Slattery, Scott Lee, Tyler Jamison, Adam Eggert, <strong>Vinoin Vincely</strong>, Darren Wong, Yuliang Guo, Jeffrey Brock, and Mahmud Khan. <br><em>"Superconducting properties of In doped ZrNi<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>In<sub>x</sub>"</em>
        <br>Elsevier: Solid State Communications vol. 291 (2019) <a href="Link" target="_blank" style="float:right">Link to article</a> <br>
      </li>
      <p style="margin-right:6em; margin-left:2em;"> The objective of this project is to understand the effects of In doping on the Superconducting properties of ZrNi<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>In<sub>x</sub> Husler alloys. Electrical resistivity and DC magnetization measurements were made which showed that the superconducting transition temperature of the compounds decreased with increasing In concentration. All samples showed paramagnetic ordering above their respective superconducting transition temperature. The observations suggest that for x ~ 0.45 the ZrNi<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>In<sub>x</sub> compound might exhibit a quantum phase transition. This paper was done as a requirement for Contemporary Physics Lab (PHY293).</p>
