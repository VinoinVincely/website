       As a young researcher, I am passionate in applying cutting-edge computational tools combined with physics-based principles to build efficient medical and laboratory diagnostic devices. I found my interest in research during my undergraduate years at Miami University where I majored in Biophysics with a minor in Bioinformatics. I began my work in the <a href="http://users.miamioh.edu/vishwak/index.html" target="_blank"> Biomedical Optics Lab (OSIM) </a> under the guidance of Dr. Karthik Vishwanath, on the project <em>"The reliability and accuracy of estimating heart-rates from RGB video recorded on a consumer grade camera"</em>. This project gave me the opportunity to work with faculty from the Department of Psychology and equip me with the skills that are vital for undertaking research. The project was later presented at the annual SPIE Photonics West conference, 2017 and published in the following proceedings.

    <p style="margin-right: 1em; margin-left: 1em; text-align:justify">
       I completed my undergraduate studies with a senior capstone project on the topic, <em>"Extracting broadband optical properties from uniform optical phantoms: Inverse Adding-Doubling (IAD) & Integrating Sphere (IS)"</em>. This project provided me a more "hands-on" experience of setting-up OSIM's first IS system for reflectance/transmittance measurements, coupled with a supercontinuum laser. I also had the opportunity to explore the working of both the IAD and Monte-Carlo Simulations, and implement it with the IS system to provide accurate estimates of optical properties. I was able to present my findings at multiple conferences, which include OSAPS and SPIE and published in SPIE's 2018 proceedings.

      Currently I am working towards a Masters in Physis with my thesis work on the the topic, <em>"Exploring light-losses in Integrating Sphere measurements using Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations"</em>. Through this project, I aim to answer the issue of light loss, a prevelant problem that plagues IS measurements. This project has allowed me to hone vital computational skills such as developing problem specific MC simulations and Incorporating deep-learning tools for data fitting.

        I had the valuable opportunity to mentor, supervise and collaborate on research porjects with students part of the inaugral summer REU program, 2019 hosted by the Department of Physics at Miami University. Through this program, I was able to collaborate with Dr. Samir Bali and his cold atom group on the project titled, <em>"Fresnel-basedmeasurement of Complex Refractive Index in Turbid Media: Comparison with Mie Calculations."</em>. This project was later presented at the Frontiers in Optics' annual conferece, by Menaka Kumar.

      I had lived in various parts of the world throughout my life, begining with my home in India, to my highschool in the Middle east and my undergraduate studies in the US. These opportunities have helped me work with people with different views and has provided me with the ability to bring a diverse set of views to any group that I work with. I am dedicated and strive to perform the best in all that I do with hopes of building a legacy which future scientist can expand upon to further human understanding.</p>
